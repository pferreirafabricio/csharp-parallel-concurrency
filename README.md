## :open_book: About

This project provides a deep dive into the inner workings of async/await and the magic of the C# compiler. The project includes practical examples and case studies, such as a web server with 2 CPUs, to illustrate these concepts in real-world scenarios.

The project also explores the differences between concurrent and parallel programming, and how to make your applications more responsive and faster with asynchronous programming. It provides insights into advanced async topics like progress reports, task cancellation, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is a resource to help me understand the concepts of async, concurrent, and parallelism and their use in practical applications.

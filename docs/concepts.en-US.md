# âš¡ Parallelism and concurrency | Conceptual Background

Concurrency includes parallelism.
If two tasks are parallel they're also concurrent.
However, not all concurrent tasks are done in parallel.

## Async and Parallelism

Two things are happening at the same instant in time.
Typically this requires some kind of hardware support.

TASK 1 |------|     (Core 1)

&nbsp;&nbsp;TASK 2   |------|   (Core 2)

### Examples

#### Example: 1 CPU with 2 processors

- Starting a program is the same as starting a process
- Inside a process, a thread is started
- Process memory is isolated from each other
- Threads can access the memory of the same process
- Process are distributed by the CPUs
- The OS Scheduler manages the processes

#### Example: Heavy calculation (game, CPU, GPU, mathematical calculation)

- Parallel programming = CPU-bound stuff happening at same point in time
- Threads are executed on the CPU
- For parallel programming, you need multiple CPU cores
- For Async programming, you do not need multiple CPU cores

#### Example: Computer with a single core

- Most of the computers on the cloud use a single core, and most of them are Virtual Machine

#### Example: Windows application in a computer with only 1 core

- Draws an image in the UI
- Situation 1: The app makes a query to the database
  - it will take some amount of time
  - the thread will actively wait, it will block the CPU (ex: stares at the cloak) until the database returns the query
  - the app will be frozen
- Situation 2: The app makes a query to the database
  - the code will be async
  - we let the database do the job in the background
    - something else is busy, not the CPU (the disk, the network, the database, etc)
  - from the point the view of the CPU we are free (ex: set an alarm timer)
  - at some point in time the database will return and trigger the code to process
  - *tasks are not CPU bound

#### Study case: JavaScript

- single core and single thread
- does not support parallel programming natively
- one of the best languages when comes to async programming

#### Study case: C\#

- support parallel and async programming

#### Example: web server with 2 CPUs

- The server is (probably) a single process with a thread pool (free and idle threads)
  - by default, the number of threads in the pool is equal to the number of CPU cores (ex: t1 and t2)
  - *threads are heavy, and use a pretty amount of memory
  - the thread pool can not grow indefinitely
    - try to keep the number of threads small

##### Not async

- Users send an HTTP GET Request to get a video
  - a thread is assigned to the HTTP request (ex: t1) from the thread pools (when the thread is assigned it no longer will be free and available at the thread pool)
  - the code tries to get the image from the disk
  - when we get multiple requests, from 2 or more clients it will be a problem because we have limited CPUs so these threads keep waiting

##### Async

- Users send an HTTP GET Request to get a video
  - thread 1 will locked for a short time, just to "ask" the DB for the video
  - then the thread will right back to the thread pool
  - with that, we can handle way more work
  - when the response is ready it is sent back to the client
  - with 1 thread we can process multiple HTTP requests

> Asynchronous programming is always used when you do non-CPU bound work, like a Database, a file server, a network, etc.

## Concurrency

Start and to their work and end in overlapping periods of time.

TASK 1 start ------- end

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TASK 2   start ------ end

### Example: Processor with only 1 core

The operating system will set timers and every time the timer fires they quickly switch tasks.
A little bit of work in each task.
The processor is jumping from one task to another quickly.
It's actually sequential but just chopping it into little blocks
